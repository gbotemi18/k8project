# Kubernetes Project: IP Address Reversal Web Application

## Project Overview
Build a complete web application that displays the origin public IP address of requests in reverse format, deploy it to Kubernetes using CI/CD, and set up monitoring with alerts.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Web Application Development
**Objective**: Create a web application that reverses and stores IP addresses

**Requirements**:
- Write a web application in any programming language
- Display the origin public IP address of incoming requests in reverse format
- **Example**: IP `1.2.3.4` should display as `4.3.2.1`
- Store the reversed IP addresses in a database of your choice

**Technical Considerations**:
- Choose appropriate web framework (Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, Go, etc.)
- Select database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
- Handle IP address parsing and reversal logic
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### 2. Containerization & CI/CD Pipeline
**Objective**: Automate the build and deployment process

**Requirements**:
- Build a Docker image of your application
- Set up CI/CD pipeline on a platform of choice (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
- Automate the following steps:
  - Build Docker image
  - Push image to container registry (Docker Hub, GCR, ECR, etc.)
  - Deploy to Kubernetes using ArgoCD and Helm chart

**Technical Considerations**:
- Create proper Dockerfile with multi-stage builds
- Set up Helm chart with deployment, service, and ingress configurations
- Configure ArgoCD application for GitOps deployment
- Use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for $300 free credits

### 3. Infrastructure Monitoring & Alerting
**Objective**: Monitor the Kubernetes cluster and application health

**Requirements**:
- Set up infrastructure monitoring using kube-prometheus-stack
- Create alerts for service downtime
- Use Blackbox Exporter for external health checks

**Technical Considerations**:
- Deploy Prometheus, Grafana, and AlertManager
- Configure Blackbox Exporter for HTTP endpoint monitoring
- Set up alerting rules for service availability
- Create Grafana dashboards for monitoring

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Application Development (Week 1)
1. Choose technology stack (language, framework, database)
2. Develop web application with IP reversal logic
3. Implement database integration
4. Add proper error handling and logging
5. Test application locally

### Phase 2: Containerization (Week 2)
1. Create Dockerfile with optimized multi-stage build
2. Build and test Docker image locally
3. Set up container registry account
4. Test image push/pull process

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline (Week 3)
1. Set up CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions recommended)
2. Create workflow for automated builds
3. Configure image registry integration
4. Set up ArgoCD application
5. Test complete deployment pipeline

### Phase 4: Kubernetes Deployment (Week 4)
1. Set up GCP Kubernetes cluster
2. Install ArgoCD on the cluster
3. Deploy application using Helm chart
4. Configure ingress for public access
5. Verify application functionality

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Alerting (Week 5)
1. Deploy kube-prometheus-stack
2. Configure Blackbox Exporter
3. Set up alerting rules
4. Create Grafana dashboards
5. Test monitoring and alerting

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Web application displays reversed IP addresses correctly
- ✅ Application is accessible via public URL
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline builds and deploys automatically
- ✅ Monitoring shows cluster and application metrics
- ✅ Alerts trigger when service is down
- ✅ All deliverables are documented and accessible

## Notes
- GCP provides $300 free credits sufficient for this project
- Consider using managed Kubernetes (GKE) for easier setup
- Implement proper security practices (secrets management, RBAC)
- Document all configuration and deployment steps
- Include troubleshooting guides in README
